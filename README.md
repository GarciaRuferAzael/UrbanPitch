# UrbanPitch
UrbanPitch is a mobile app developed in Kotlin, native android language, that helps football lovers discover, share, and rate urban football pitches in their city.
Whether you’re looking for a 5-a-side turf, a hidden street court, or just a flat piece of concrete to kick the ball around — UrbanPitch connects players with real places to play.
